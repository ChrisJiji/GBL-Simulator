# Pokemon Go Battle League Simulator and AI
Final project for CS 686 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. The final report can be found [here](CS_686_Final_Project.pdf). We built from scratch a Pok√©mon Go Battle League Simulator using an object-oriented programming paradigm, the class diagram of which can be found below.

We then implemented two Neural Fictitious Self-Play algorithms, once using complete state information, and one using incomplete state information, to compare self-play learning with perfect and imperfect information. More details can be found in the report.
